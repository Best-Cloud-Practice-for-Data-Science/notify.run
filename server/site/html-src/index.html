    <strong>notify.run</strong> lets you send notifications to your own phone or desktop with minimal fuss. This is primarily useful
    for tracking the progress of long-running compute jobs.
</p>

<p>
    notify.run is entirely open source, and this hosted instance is free for you to use. Consider it a public service from
    <a href="https://paulbutler.org">me</a> to the deep learning and scientific computing community.
</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<div class="ui segment" id="quickstart" style="min-height: 120px;">
    <p>Using this service requires JavaScript to be enabled.</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Each user of notify.run is assigned a
    <strong>channel</strong>, identified by a random string. Devices which support the
    <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=push-api">Web Push API</a>, including Chrome and Firefox for desktop and Android, can subscribe to notifications on a channel and
    show a pop-up notification. Other devices, such as iOS Safari, do not yet support the API needed for background notifications,
    but they can still be used to see a list of recent notifications.
</p>

<p>
    Each channel has its own HTTP(S) endpoint. When you
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">POST</a> a message to that endpoint, notify.run relays it to every subscription on that channel.
</p>
<p>
    notify.run uses standard APIs for both sending and subscribing to notifications, which means that it can be used without
    installling any software.
    <!--If you prefer, you can use the command-line tool and Python package to simplify integration
    with your workflow.-->

<h2>Integrations</h2>

<h3>Command-line interface</h3>

<p>
    The command-line interface and Python API are part of the
    <samp>notify-run</samp> Python package. You can install both using the
    <samp>pip</samp> package manager
</p>

<pre>pip install notify-run</pre>

<p>
    Once it has been installed, you can register a new channel like so:
</p>

<pre>notify-run --new-channel</pre>

<p>
    Alternatively, you can configure it to use a channel that already exists:
</p>

<pre>notify-run -c https://notify.run/<strong>[channel name]</strong></pre>

<p>
    The configuration is stored in the
    <samp>~/.notify-run</samp> file in your home directory. It will be picked up by subsequent runs of
    <samp>notify-run</samp> as well as the
    <samp>notify_run</samp>
    Python module.

<h2>Self-hosting</h2>

<p>
    This public instance is freely provided for your convenience, but does not have an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">SLA</a>
    and should not be used for notification messages containing private data. For more demanding use cases, you may prefer to
    run your own instance of the server on your own network.
</p>
<p>
    Refer to these instructions to run your own instance of the service.
